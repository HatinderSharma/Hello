      "description": "Registration of a trade mark can be revoked in certain circumstances where it should not have been registered in the first place. This is only possible within the first 12 months of registration.\n\nGenerally, revocation of registration is followed immediately by revocation of acceptance, resulting in the subject trade mark application returning to the examiner for a re-examination. Only in very rare cases would a revocation of registration return to the Accepted status, allowing an opposition to proceed instead of a re-examination by a trade mark examiner.\n\nRevocation of registration is rare. It is not a substitute for court action to challenge someone else’s entitlement to a trade mark, rather, it is about identifying information showing that the registration should not have occurred in the first place. The power to revoke will usually only be used where there is a clear case of error by IP Australia, or new circumstances become known.\n\nThe Registrar of Trade Marks (the Registrar) is not required to consider a request for revocation, but if they do, they must consider all the circumstances and whether it is reasonable to revoke the registration, including whether there is a more appropriate remedy (such as court challenge).\n\nIn making a revocation decision, IP Australia can take account of a range of circumstances that could have prevented registration. This includes reasons which go to the heart of whether the application should have been accepted, such as whether it is scandalous, likely to cause confusion, not sufficiently distinctive, or too similar to another registered trade mark.",

As such, it might be risky to base your entire enforcement strategy on this procedure expecting IP Australia to make a revocation decision, instead of using other enforcement mechanisms such as challenging the trade mark registration through the court system.\n\nWhile IP Australia does not publish the details of the party who requested revocation, it is possible for documents to be obtained under Freedom of Information Act 1982 so the owner of the trade mark can ascertain the identity of the party who requested revocation.\n\nThis procedure provides a much more limited opportunity to participate in the decision-making process, when compared to challenging a trade mark registration through the opposition and hearing procedures or courts.\n\nEven if revocation of acceptance follows revocation of registration, the application will be returned to examination and the owner of the application will be given 15 months to overcome the grounds for rejection preventing their application from achieving acceptance.\n\nIn some rare cases, the application may only be reverted to acceptance stage even though the registration has been revoked, meaning that opposition process would need to be initiated to block the application proceeding to registration once more. You might need to undertake an opposition in order to prevent registration occurring again."
